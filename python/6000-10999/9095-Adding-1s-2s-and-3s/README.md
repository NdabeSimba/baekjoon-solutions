## Task

Integer 4 can be expressed as a sum of 1s, 2s, and 3s in seven different ways as follows:

- 1+1+1+1,
- 1+1+2,
- 1+2+1,
- 2+1+1,
- 2+2,
- 1+3, and
- 3+1.

Write a program that determines the number of ways in which a given integer can be expressed as a sum of 1s, 2s, and 3s. You may assume that the integer is positive and less than 11.
